        <h1>No Longer Human by Osamu Dazai</h1>
        <div class="rating">
            ★★★★☆
        </div>

        <p><strong>No Longer Human</strong> by Osamu Dazai is such an amazing book if you want a thought-provoking experience. The novel offers a truly unfiltered look at raw human conditions through the eyes of the protagonist, Ōba Yōzō. The author's way of telling a story of selfhood actually makes you think about topics like identity and how a person survives in everyday life.</p>

        <p>Dazai's writing, especially when he compares everyday humans to creatures stuck in the wild, is very interesting. Yōzō, for example, links humans with animals, such as an ox. He, on the other hand, sees himself as much less than that, picturing himself as a horsefly sitting on the ox — this shows his first disconnect as a human being.</p>

        <p>When you realize that this novel is, overall, a parallel to Osamu Dazai's own life, it becomes a lot darker. Yōzō's descent into an unknown darkness, his inability to fit within societal norms, and his uncontrollable, persistent feeling of playing roles in life all reflect the personal struggles of the author. Once you understand this, the book isn't really just a fictional story — it almost reads like a memoir.</p>

        <p><strong>No Longer Human</strong> also has more of a philosophical view. Dazai explores the parts of humanity that are rarely seen, the parts of our emotions that we don’t show anyone. The book reveals the tricks the human mind plays — pretending to be happy or even content with life — and how these performances often hurt both the person performing and those being performed for.</p>

        <p>This entire book reminded me of the philosophy in *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus, especially this quote from the book:</p>

        <blockquote class="quote">
            “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.” 
            <br>- Albert Camus, *The Myth of Sisyphus*
        </blockquote>

        <p class="quote">
            “The weak fear happiness itself. They can harm themselves on cotton wool. Sometimes they are wounded even by happiness.” 
            <br>- Osamu Dazai, *No Longer Human*
