            ★★★★☆

        <p><strong>The Secret History</strong> by Donna Tartt is a story about intellect and human infirmity. The story is told through the eyes of the main character, Richard Papen. It reads almost like a memoir—his reflection on past events. Donna Tartt's writing is very immersive, with strong character and world-building, but it’s also very elusive. Throughout the novel, there are key details left unsaid, like conversations Richard Papen saw but couldn’t hear. This inherently reinforces the idea that the reader is meant to piece together the memories of the main character.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, Donna Tartt is able to create a contrast between emotional detachment and intense attachment among the characters. A good example of this is the character Henry, who is rather cold and very calculated, prioritizing philosophy over human relationships. This allows him to rationalize terrible actions, yet by the end, it’s very clear he is just like everyone else on the inside when faced with a huge conflict. On the other hand, Richard holds a very deep, almost blind, praise for his friends, which creates tension and highlights how all of these social dynamics combined shape the fall of the group.</p>

        <p>The overall story is deeply centered around ancient Greek ideas and mythology. This is the main drive for many of the characters’ actions. Henry holds an immense obsession with Greek ideals like transcendence and respects Greek heroes, leading him to justify something that isn’t justifiable. At the center of this is a character named Julian, the professor whose teachings inspire the group’s collapse. His focus on esoteric studies of Greek culture blurs even moral lines, encouraging his students to follow dangerous ideals without ever once considering the real-world consequences.</p>
