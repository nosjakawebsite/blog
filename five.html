        <h1>The Symposium by Plato</h1>

        <p><strong>The Symposium</strong> by Plato is a book that offers an interesting look into the nature of human relationships. The book explores whether love (eros) is about physical desire or whether it revolves around something greater. It presents love as both an instinctual drive and a radical force that propels one toward wisdom, virtue, and the "Form of Beauty." Plato presents a series of eulogies from very different perspectives, prompting the reader to consider whether love and desire are the same or opposing forces. It challenges traditional thoughts about passion in human life.</p>

        <p>Phaedrus, a mortal character in the book, starts the dialogue by arguing that love inspires honorable deeds, in particular self-sacrifice and courage. Phaedrus views love as a motivational force that drives individuals to seek honor as well as perform acts of heroism, for example, as in war. Although I would agree that his emphasis on love's power to enhance human behavior is good, he focuses inherently on its outside manifestations, neglecting a more complex dynamic between love and desire.</p>

        <p>Pausanias follows this eulogy by adding an important separation between "Common Love" and "Heavenly Love." According to Pausanias, Common Love is fixed in physical attraction as well as fleeting pleasures, while, on the other hand, Heavenly Love is about finding intellectual and moral growth. This view recognizes the dual nature within eros, adding to the discussion something that goes beyond physical matters. However, the flaw with this view is that it fails to take into account how both the intellectual and physical acts of love can coexist and even complement one another.</p>

        <p>Eryximachus shifts the conversation entirely. He presents love as a universal force that governs nature, health, and relationships. By expanding eros beyond just human interaction, he offers a unique and more personal perspective. Although I would argue that his overly scientific approach strips "love" of its emotional and passionate essence, his argument is overall insightful when examining eros from a different perspective, even if it feels disconnected from love and desire.</p>

        <p>Aristophanes adds a very mythological point of view to the discussion and, in my opinion, is the most memorable and contributes the most to the topic. He describes love as the search for our missing half, explaining this through an ancient myth in which humans were originally whole beings without any gender. However, after they began causing trouble and creating chaos, the god Zeus split them apart. Following this event, the now-separated humans sought to find their other half. This view captures the longing and emotional fulfillment that love brings.</p>

        <p>Aristophanes’ argument also finds a parallel in mythological stories, such as that of Thor, whose mission for worthiness involves proving his connection both to others and to himself. Just as Thor's story reflects the struggle to reclaim balance and power, Aristophanes’ myth portrays humanity's deep desire for completeness and harmony. However, this perspective is not particularly rigorous and tends to oversimplify love as merely a quest for dependency.</p>

        <p>Agathon’s speech was one of my least favorites. He presents love as the youngest and most honorable of the gods, characterized by qualities like beauty, creativity, and wisdom. He portrays love as aspirational. His argument, though, is insanely idealistic; he only thinks of love as a perfect thing without addressing or even looking at its contradictions. His view lacks the depth needed to truly explore eros.</p>

        <p>Socrates' speech is guided by a priestess named Diotima. Her teachings offer the most structured perspective on eros. Diotima describes love as a ladder of ascent, (starting from physical attraction to the pursuit of beauty and truth). However, this view excludes people who experience love as a passionate and emotional bond, by prioritizing intellectual love instead. Socrates' argument, I think, undermines physical desire in the experience of eros.</p>

        <p><strong>The Symposium</strong> by Plato is such a good interaction between love and desire; the writing highlights both the complexities and interconnections in such a great way. While each speaker in the story provides an entirely different perspective, it’s like six different philosophers written by one man. A masterpiece of writing.</p>

        <h2>Quote from The Symposium</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            “According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other half.”
