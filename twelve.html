        <div class="rating">
            ★★★★☆

        <p><strong>The Virgin Suicides</strong> by Jeffrey Eugenides, I think, is very well written and does a very good job at explaining the tragic lives of the Lisbon sisters as seen in the first person of the neighborhood boys. At first, I thought the book was written by a woman, given its heavy focus on the struggles that I think many women go through. However, after discovering that the book was written by a man, it made more sense, as the story is about boys trying to understand what happened to the Lisbon sisters. I also think it adds to the idea of the male gaze. I think the word choice in the book was also very well done, with some parts being somewhat poetic in a way, which I think creates a somewhat eerie and dream-like atmosphere. However, there were some sections that I thought were complex with symbolism that could be difficult to understand on your first read. Because of this, I think that it would be best to read this book two or more times to fully understand the story.</p>
