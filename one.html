        <h1>The Overstory by Richard Powers</h1>

            ★★★★★

        <p>The Overstory by Richard Powers is one of the most beautifully crafted novels that I've read! It's very well crafted, even up to the way it successfully mirrors that of a tree. The book is divided into three main sections—Roots, Trunk, Crown, and Seeds—each representing a new stage of growth, connection, and peace between the 8 characters.</p>

        <h2>Roots</h2>
        <p>In Roots, Powers introduces each of the 8 characters individually, letting their stories get told like a new seed that just got planted in the backyard, trying to find its way in a world we don’t know. Every character’s story starts in their past and later develops into their relationships with the world they live in.</p>

        <h2>Trunk</h2>
        <p>In Trunk, each character’s story is put into one chapter; it goes back and forth between them. A lot happens in this chapter, everything from death, romance, and sadness. This chapter, although very well written, did feel quite long, but I feel as if Richard Powers wrote it in the way of a tree trunk growing, which takes quite a while.</p>

        <h2>Crown</h2>
        <p>In Crown, this is when the most action happens. Characters die and become activists, terrorists, and felons, all for the common goal. All their goals weave into one goal that is bigger than all of theirs. This is, in my opinion, the best chapter in the book.</p>

        <h2>Seeds</h2>
        <p>Finally, in Seeds, Powers explores themes like rebirth and resolution. The characters find peace in whatever situation there is—from two life sentences in federal prison to changing their name and working as a therapist. It leaves the story with a huge sense of hope. The characters believe their efforts might one day grow into something bigger, like a tree that has been burned down.</p>

        <h2>Quotes from The Overstory</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            "Thrones have crumbled and new empires arisen; great ideas have been born and great pictures painted, and the world revolutionized by science and invention; and still no man can say how many centuries this Oak will endure or what nations and creeds it may outlive."

        <p class="quote">  
            "If you're holding a sapling in your hand when the Messiah arrives, first plant the sapling and then go out and greet the Messiah."
