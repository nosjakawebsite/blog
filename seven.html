        <p><strong>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</strong> by Leo Tolstoy is a decent book for understanding life, death, and the search for meaning. This novella’s main focus is on the character Ivan Ilyich, a high-ranking member in the court system. Ivan is later forced to confront his temporality after being diagnosed by many doctors with a terminal illness. The main focus of this story is the critique of the emptiness of a life that's been defined by societal expectations and material matters. Leo Tolstoy did a very good job, in my opinion, of pulling apart the pursuit of status that leaves someone unprepared for the reality of death. This book forces you to confront life and the good and bad parts within it.</p>

        <p>My favorite part of this novel comes after Ivan's death, when the people in town become aware of it. His colleagues and even his acquaintances, upon hearing the dreadful news of their friend’s passing, react not with grief but with a calculation of what they might gain—both physically and emotionally—from his death, such as promotions in the court or financial benefits. This whole scene is such a good representation of the self-serving tendencies of human nature. It is the first significant moment where this theme emerges, and it continues to appear throughout the novel.</p>

        <p>Although this novella by Leo Tolstoy is excellent, my one critique is that I just wished it was longer. I wanted to hear more and just keep reading.</p>

        <h2>The Philosophy of The Death of Ivan Ilyich</h2>
        <p><strong>Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich</strong>, in my opinion, is an exploration of existentialist themes. The book addresses important questions about life, death, and the search for meaning. Through the story of the main character Ivan Ilyich, Leo Tolstoy is able to examine societal expectations and the chase for authentic self-awareness. Throughout the entire novella, it emphasizes existentialist concepts like individual freedom, authenticity, and the confrontation with uncertainties—all of these are central to the main character’s existential life. It starts with his life, which has been dictated by the societal norms around him and the pursuit of success. This becomes a reflection of emptiness and a realization that becomes so clear when he faces the unstoppable reality of death.</p>

        <p>The existentialist themes become particularly important as Ivan confronts his soon demise. As he fights against his suffering, Ivan starts to question the meaning of life, which he begins to see as stripped away from its true purpose. This entire moment captures the existential confrontation with the absurd as well, the realization that life lacks meaning unless one decides to create it. This relates to existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus; both of these thinkers believe that people often avoid confronting life's deeper questions until something urgent requires them to.</p>

        <p>A prominent detail in this novella is Ivan's obsession with furnishing his new house. This is a great example of his mission for stability and meaning. However, this fixation is the first step toward his downfall. His injury while decorating is a symbol of how his pursuit of materialistic things left his soul vulnerable. While the injury is just a physical wound on the outside, on the inside, it is a result of misplaced priorities, showing how a life full of inauthentic achievements stems from misguided priorities.</p>

        <p>Leo Tolstoy's novella explores how Ivan's illness forces him to confront life's uncertainties. This is when he comes to realize that things like wealth, status, and societal norms, which once governed his life, aren't enough to protect him from death or ease his suffering. The story is an example of a clear existential message: a life focused solely on external goals, without taking the chance to understand one's true self, is ultimately unsatisfying. Ivan's suffering before his death becomes the vehicle through which Leo Tolstoy critiques the pursuit of an external life at the cost of genuine human connections.</p>

        <h2>Quote from The Death of Ivan Ilyich</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            “Can it be that I have not lived as one ought?" suddenly came into his head. "But how not so, when I've done everything as it should be done?”
