        <p><strong>The Stranger</strong> by Albert Camus is very simple yet profound. It has a very straightforward structure that makes it easy to read, at least on the surface. However, underneath, the book provides a deeply thought-provoking exploration of life and societal norms. I think that, within this book, Albert Camus was able to show the philosophy of absurdism with great clarity, leaving you trying to understand more and look deeper even after you finish the book.</p>

        <p>The novel follows Meursault, a man who gets arrested for shooting someone on the beach during a day trip. However, in my opinion, it felt like he wasn’t condemned so much for killing another man but rather for his inability to conform to society’s expectations. You see this throughout the entire court case, which was supposed to center on the shooting at the beach. Instead, it became a judgment of everything Meursault had failed to do—his failure to cry at his mother’s funeral, his detachment from life, and his lack of conventional emotion. Camus demonstrates how society punishes those who are different and don’t follow its rules so perfectly, in my opinion, making Meursault a stranger in a world that demands conformity.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, the best part of this novel is how Meursault begins to realize he is no longer a free man. This idea of being no longer free doesn’t come to him naturally. Instead, Meursault needs to be told that he’s no longer free by a police officer and the court officers. His life, up until this point, had always been defined by routine and passive acceptance. He is the kind of person who gets used to whatever life brings. I believe Camus emphasizes the human capacity to adapt to anything, even imprisonment. Despite all of this, Meursault barely notices the transition between a life of freedom and his life in prison.</p>

        <h2>Quote from The Stranger</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            "Maman died today. Or yesterday maybe, I don’t know. I got a telegram from the home: 'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Faithfully yours.' That doesn’t mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday."
