        <p>One of Albert Camus's best strengths as a writer, in my opinion, is his ability to create characters that you hate. Jean-Baptiste Clamence, the main character in the book, is a perfect example of this theory. He denounces the thought of misogyny yet just a sentence after, he admits to exploiting women to his benefit, with hardly offering anything back to them in return. This contradiction makes Clamence repulsive as a person but compelling, as you want to know what he's thinking. Another thing that proves my point about Camus as a writer is that he writes this book with a lack of clarity about who Clamence is speaking to, which forces the reader into a position of a judge.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, the most pivotal moment in this novel is the suicide of the woman on the bridge. This entire event exposes Jean-Baptiste Clamence's biggest hypocrisy. While he usually prides himself on small acts of goodwill — such as when he helped a blind man cross the street — it is very prominent that these good deeds are more about boosting his self-image than actual genuine kindness. Yet, when he is faced with an actual real moment of crisis, like saving a woman from committing suicide, he does absolutely nothing. This starts his downfall and triggers his existential crisis. This leads to the start of his constructing his philosophy as a "Judge-Penitent," a role that allows one to admit their flaws while also casting judgment on others.</p>

        <p>The ending of <strong>The Fall</strong> brings Jean-Baptiste Clamence’s confessions to this unknown character full circle. This is when he fully embraces the hypocrisy that's stuck within his life as well as his role as a "Judge-Penitent." A good metaphor to show this is the painting named "Just Judges," which symbolizes his realization. Judging others is inseparable from judging yourself. Through this entire scene, Albert Camus turns the book back to the reader, challenging the reader to confront our moral feelings as well as hypocrisies.</p>

        <p><strong>The Fall</strong> by Albert Camus offers so much information and thought on topics like guilt, human nature, and existential self-reflection. The novel is full of honesty, and Jean-Baptiste Clamence’s moral contradictions make it more of a philosophical read.</p>

        <h2>Quote from The Fall</h2>
        <p class="quote">
            "I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all know there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to condemn such joys as selfishness."
            <br>- Albert Camus
